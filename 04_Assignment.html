  <h3>Q.1 What is JavaScript? </h3>
  <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia,
    animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve
    with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
  </p>
  <h3>What is the use of isNaN function? </h3>
  <p>
    The JavaScript isNaN() Function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It returns
    true if the value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number.isNaN() Method.
    -syntax isNaN( value )
    Parameter Values: This method accepts a single parameter as mentioned above and described below:
    value: It is a required value passed in the isNaN() function.
    Return Value: It returns a Boolean value i.e. returns true if the value is NaN else returns false.
  </p>

  <h3>Q.2 What is negative Infinity?</h3>
  <p>
    The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to represent a value that is the lowest
    available. This means that no other number is lesser than this value. It can be generated using a self-made
    function or by an arithmetic operation.

    <br>Negative infinity results in -0(different from 0 ) when divided by any other number.
    <br>When divided by itself or positive infinity, negative infinity return NaN
    <br>Negative infinity, when divided by any positive number (apart from positive infinity) is negative infinity.
    <br>Negative infinity, divided by any negative number (apart from negative infinity) is positive infinity.
    <br>If we multiply negative infinity with NaN, we will get NaN as a result.
    <br>The product of 0 and negative infinity is Nan.
    <br>The product of two negative infinities is always a positive infinity.
    <br>The product of both positive and negative infinity is always negative infinity.
  </p>
  <h3>Q.3 Which company developed JavaScript? </h3>
  <p>
    Brendan Eich developed JavaScript, a computer language, in just ten days in May 1995. Initially called Mocha,
    then LiveScript, it finally became known as JavaScript. It was designed for the client-side of websites to add
    dynamic and interactive elements to static HTML pages.

    <br>JavaScript was first implemented in Netscape Navigator, the most popular browser at the time. Microsoft
    quickly
    adopted it for Internet Explorer. Its ease of use and unique position as the only client-side scripting language
    made JavaScript popular among web developers.

    <br>Over the years, JavaScript popularity grew, and it was used to create a variety of web applications,
    including
    online games, dynamic menus, and form validation. A new version, ECMAScript 4, was planned in 2002 but was
    abandoned due to disagreements among browser vendors.
    Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the
    var or const keyword. If we use ‘typeof’ operator to get the value of an undeclared variable, we will face the
    runtime error with the return value as “undefined”. The scope of the undeclared variables is always global.

    <br>Today, JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages, used by about 95% of websites. It is not
    only crucial for web development but also for creating server-side applications, desktop and mobile apps, and
    even programming robots and hardware.
  </p>

  <h3>Q.4 What are undeclared and undefined variables? </h3>
  <p>Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not a
    keyword.
  </p>
  <p>Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the
    var or const keyword. If we use type of operator to get the value of an undeclared variable, we will face the
    runtime error with the return value as “undefined”. The scope of the undeclared variables is always global.
  </p>
  <h3>Q.5 Write the code for adding new elements dynamically? </h3>

  <h3>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState? </h3>
  <h3>What is === operator? </h3>
  <p>The strict equality operator (===) behaves identically to the abstract equality operator (==) except no type
    conversion is done, and the types must be the same to be considered equal.

  </p>
  <h3>Q.6 How can the style/class of an element be changed? </h3>
  <pre>
    Changing style
      1. Inline styles: Use the style property to change individual styles.
      - element.style.property = value;
      - Example: document.getElementById("example").style.color = "red";

      2. CSS styles: Use the style.cssText property to change multiple styles at once.
      - element.style.cssText = "property1: value1; property2: value2;";
      - Example: document.getElementById("example").style.cssText = "color: red; font-size: 24px;";

      Changing Classes:
      1. Add a class: Use the classList.add() method.
          - element.classList.add("className");
          - Example: document.getElementById("example").classList.add("example-class");
      2. Remove a class: Use the classList.remove() method.
          - element.classList.remove("className");
          - Example: document.getElementById("example").classList.remove("example-class");
      3. Toggle a class: Use the classList.toggle() method.
          - element.classList.toggle("className");
          - Example: document.getElementById("example").classList.toggle("example-class");
      4. Replace a class: Use the classList.replace() method (not supported in older browsers).
          - element.classList.replace("oldClassName", "newClassName");
          - Example: document.getElementById("example").classList.replace("old-class", "new-class");

      Before changing styles or classes, you need to select the element(s) you want to modify. You can use:

      1. document.getElementById("id") for a single element by ID.
      2. document.getElementsByClassName("className") for multiple elements by class name.
      3. document.querySelectorAll("selector") for multiple elements by CSS selector.

      Remember to replace "example" and "className" with your actual element ID and class names.
    </pre>
  <h3>Q.7 How to read and write a file using JavaScript? </h3>
  <pre>
    Reading and writing files in JavaScript can be achieved using various methods, depending on the environment and requirements.
    Here are some common approaches:

    Client-side (Browser):
    
    1. FileReader and FileWriter APIs: For reading and writing files locally on the client-side, you can use the FileReader and FileWriter APIs.
     However, these APIs have limited support and security restrictions.
    
    Server-side (Node.js):
    
    1. fs (File System) module: Node.js provides the built-in fs module for reading and writing files. You can use methods like:
        - fs.readFile() and fs.writeFile() for asynchronous operations.
        - fs.readFileSync() and fs.writeFileSync() for synchronous operations.
    2. fs.promises: Node.js 14+ introduces fs.promises, allowing you to use async/await syntax for file operations.
    3. Streams: You can use Node.js streams to read and write files in a more efficient and scalable way.
   </pre>

  <h3>Q.8 What are all the looping structures in JavaScript? </h3>
  <pre>
        1. for loop: Allows you to run a block of code for a specified number of iterations.

        for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          console.log(i);
        }
        
        2. while loop: Runs a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
        
        var i = 0;
        while (i < 10) {
          console.log(i);
          i++;
        }
        
        3. do-while loop: Similar to the while loop, but the code block is executed at least once before the condition is checked.
        
        var i = 0;
        do {
          console.log(i);
          i++;
        } while (i < 10);

        4. forEach loop (used with arrays): Executes a function for each element in an array.
        
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].forEach(function(element) {
          console.log(element);
        });
        
        5. for...in loop (used with objects): Iterates over the properties of an object.
        
        var obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
        for (var prop in obj) {
          console.log(obj[prop]);
        }
        
        6. for...of loop (used with iterable objects like arrays, strings, etc.): Similar to foreach, but allows for more flexibility.
        
        for (var element of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) {
          console.log(element);
        }
        
    <pre>
    <h3>Q.9 How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript? </h3>
    <pre>
      In JavaScript, you can convert a string of any base to an integer using the built-in parseInt() function.
      The parseInt() function takes two arguments:

      1. The string to be converted
      2. The base of the number in the string (optional, defaults to 10)
      
      Here's the syntax:
      
      parseInt(string, base)
      
      For example:
      parseInt('1010', 2) // Output: 10
      
    </pre>
  <h3>Q.10 What is the function of the delete operator? </h3>
  <pre>
    The delete operator in JavaScript is used to remove a property from an object, or to remove a element from an
    array.
  
    In JavaScript, the delete operator is used to:
      
    1. Remove a property from an object: It deletes a property and its value from an object.
    2. Remove an element from an array: It removes an element from an array, leaving a hole (undefined) in its place.
      
    Syntax:
      
    delete object.property
    delete array[index]
      
    Examples:
      
    1. Delete object property:
      
    const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
    delete person.age;
    console.log(person); // Output: { name: 'John' }
      
    1. Delete array element:
      
    const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    delete arr[2];
    console.log(arr); // Output: [1, 2, undefined, 4, 5]
      
  </pre>
  <h3>Q.11 What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript? </h3>
  <pre>
    detailed list of popup boxes available in JavaScript:

    1. Alert Box: Displays a message with an "OK" button.
        - Syntax: alert(message)
    2. Confirm Box: Displays a message with "OK" and "Cancel" buttons.
        - Syntax: confirm(message)
        - Returns true if the user clicks "OK" and false if they click "Cancel".
    3. Prompt Box: Displays a message with an input field and "OK" and "Cancel" buttons.
        - Syntax: prompt(message, defaultvalue)
        - Returns the user's input as a string, or null if they click "Cancel".
    4. Dialog Box (HTML5): A customizable popup box that can contain HTML content.
        - Syntax: <dialog>...</dialog> (HTML) and dialog.showModal() (JavaScript)
    5. Toast Notification (HTML5): A small, temporary popup box that appears at the bottom of the screen.
        - Syntax: navigator.notifications.createNotification(title, options)
    6. Modal Window: A customizable popup box that can contain HTML content and is often used for more complex interactions.
        - Syntax: Various libraries and frameworks provide modal window functionality, such as Bootstrap Modal or jQuery UI Dialog.
    7. Popup Window: A new browser window that can be used to display content.
        - Syntax: window.open(url, name, features)
    8. Tooltip: A small popup box that appears when a user hovers over an element.
        - Syntax: Various libraries and frameworks provide tooltip functionality, such as Bootstrap Tooltip or jQuery UI Tooltip.    
  </pre>
  <h3>Q.12 What is the use of Void (0)? </h3>
  <pre>
    void(0) is a JavaScript expression that evaluates to undefined. It's often used in various contexts, including:

    1. Hyperlink placeholder: In HTML, href="javascript:void(0)" is used as a placeholder for hyperlinks that don't need to navigate to a URL.
    2. Event handling: return void(0) or return false is used to prevent default browser behavior, such as preventing a form submission or link navigation.
    3. Bookmarklets: void(0) is used to create bookmarklets, which are small JavaScript scripts that can be saved as bookmarks.
    4. Code optimization: In some cases, void(0) can be used to optimize code by avoiding unnecessary computations or return values.
    5. IE compatibility: In older versions of Internet Explorer, void(0) was used to fix issues with the href attribute.
    
    Using void(0) has some advantages, such as:
    
    - It's a short and concise way to represent an undefined value.
    - It can help prevent errors by avoiding unnecessary computations or return values.
    - It's compatible with most browsers and versions.    
  </pre>

  <h3>Q.13 How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript? </h3>
  <pre>
    There are several ways to force a page to load another page in JavaScript:

    1. window.location: Set the window.location property to the URL of the new page.
    
    window.location = '(link unavailable)';
    
    1. window.location.href: Set the window.location.href property to the URL of the new page.
    
    window.location.href = '(link unavailable)';
    
    1. window.location.replace(): Use the window.location.replace() method to replace the current page with a new one.
    
    window.location.replace('(link unavailable)');
    
    1. window.location.assign(): Use the window.location.assign() method to load a new page.
    
    window.location.assign('(link unavailable)');
    
    1. window.open(): Use the window.open() method to open a new page in the current window or a new tab.
    
    window.open('(link unavailable)', '_self'); // Current window
    window.open('(link unavailable)', '_blank'); // New tab

    Also, be aware of the differences between these methods:

    - replace() and assign() will replace the current page's history entry, while href and open() will create a new history entry.
    - _self will load the new page in the current window, while _blank will load it in a new tab.
  </pre>

  <h3>Q.14 What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript? </h3>
  <pre>Using innerHTML in JavaScript has several disadvantages:

    1. Security risks: innerHTML can introduce cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if user-generated content is not properly sanitized.
    2. Performance issues: Frequent updates to innerHTML can cause the browser to re-render the entire page, leading to performance issues.
    3. Loss of references: When updating innerHTML, all existing references to child elements are lost, which can cause issues with event listeners and other attached data.
    4. Removal of event listeners: innerHTML removes all event listeners attached to child elements, requiring re-attachment after updating.
    5. Inability to append content: innerHTML replaces the entire content, making it difficult to append new content without overwriting existing content.
    6. Browser inconsistencies: innerHTML may behave differently across browsers, leading to compatibility issues.
    7. No support for SVG or XML: innerHTML only works with HTML content, not SVG or XML.
    8. Difficult debugging: Errors in innerHTML content can be challenging to debug due to the lack of clear error messages.
    
    To avoid these disadvantages, consider using alternative methods like:
    
    - createElement and appendChild for adding new elements
    - textContent or innerText for updating text content
    - insertAdjacentHTML for inserting HTML content without replacing existing content
    - Template literals or DOM parsing libraries for safer and more efficient HTML manipulation.</pre>
